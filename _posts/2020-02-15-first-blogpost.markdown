Some of the blogs I read had the domain github.io and I got curious how to host your stuff on github.io. From there I found the link to [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and immediately loved the idea of a static site generator and the ability to write your blog in markdown.

## How to get started
I first found it difficult to understand how everything would be linked together but it is simple as that:

- you don't necessarily need to install jekyll on your machine though it hleps to preview your posts. If you want to do that, [here's how.](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/)

- you can just select one of the templates from [here](https://jekyllthemes.io/github-pages-themes), clone them and have most things set up for you already.

- you should name the repository that you clone <yourusernameatgithub>.github.io - then github automatically builds your site with jekyll every time you change that repo and publishes to https://<yourusernameatgithub>.github.io .

A blogpost that helped me get started and describes more details on how to modify templates and serve at your own domain is [this](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/).
