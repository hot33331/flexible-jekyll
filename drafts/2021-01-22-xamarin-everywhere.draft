Xamarin Forms is multiplatform with as much code-reuse as possible. I worked quite some time with iOS and android, but never had set foot to other platforms, so I wanted to see how well Xamarin Forms works out of the box on other platforms.

I wanted to cover 
* iOS
* Android
* Windows (UWP/WPF)
* Linux (GTK)
* macOS ("standard" and Frank Kruger's Catalyst version)

I used the Vs4mac Template for multiplatform app with flyout, non-shell. I updated everything to the latest Xamarin Forms and Essentials.

I documented my efforts in a github repo: [https://github.com/hot33331/XamarinFormsEverywhere](https://github.com/hot33331/XamarinFormsEverywhere)


## iOS
As expected iOS works great, no hiccups, everything is fine.

## android
See iOS.

## Windows
Now this is where things get interesting. UWP runs okay WPF is problematic.

## Linux
Problematic.

## macOS
While the "out-of-the-box" project does have some hiccups, the catalyst version works flawless and snappy.
